For the intron containing gene Tb927.8.1510 (except for the intron containing gene Tb927.8.1510 (ATP) the figure shows the genome coverage for the total (TOT), polysomal (POL), and subpolysomal (SUB) samples (biological replicates 1 to 3) of the bloodstream (BS) and procyclic (PC) form life stages. The figure also reports the genome coverage of the Splice Leader (SL) and poly(A) mRNA tails and/or poly(A) genomic tract (PA) containing reads assembled from the samples. Also shown are the ribosome profiling reads for the BSF (RiboBSF) and PCF (RiboPCF) life stages as described in Vasquex et al. 2014. The last two genomic tracks report the peptide identifications for new predicted open reading frames (PEP-new), not relevant to this section of the genome, and for all the open reading frames (PEP-all) in TritrypDB. The maximum height of each of the gene tracks is reported on the top left of each track. The top of the figure shows an ideogram of the gene structures. The three grey genomic tracks at the top report ATG codons in green and stop codons in red.
